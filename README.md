This application aims to help users characterized as vulnerable and/or elderly to have a better and safer life by recording the medication to be taken, how many pills there are in stock and alerting to take them in the most appropriate way. It will be possible for the user to see in the application the date and place where he took a particular medication and if the medication is not taken, the application will send an alert to a security contact defined by the user so that someone can help him.
   This application will also have a more interactive part and at the same time provide the reduction of memory lapses, that is, it will have two different games, one called the gallows game which is a game to guess the words and an arithmetic game that every day will have different calculations in order to stimulate the desire to play and so that users do not get bored playing the same thing over and over again.
   Finally, this application will also have a user position tracker and a fall detector, in which the latter will send a message to a safety contact so that the user can be rescued and will have a map where the nearest pharmacies can be found.
